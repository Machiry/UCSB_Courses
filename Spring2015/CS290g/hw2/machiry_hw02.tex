\section{Implement MonPro that returns the Montgomery product c and also a bool value StepFour which is True if there is a subtraction in Step 4 or False if not. Using the MonPro routine, create an implementation of the modular exponentiation algorithm MonExp}
I have implemented MonPro and MonExp using Python. The code for which is present in the file $\texttt{machiry\_monpro\_timing\_attack.py}$. Functions for MonPro and MonExp are $\texttt{mon\_pro}$ and $\texttt{mon\_exp\_attacker}$ respectively.
\section{Timing Attack}
For a given $d$ and $n$, First I generate 10000 random messages. Second, I run $mon\_exp\_compute\_total\_subtractions$  for each message $m$ to compute $m^{d}$ (mod $n$) along with total number of subtractions happened in all the $\texttt{mon\_pro}$ invocations. In code, variable $\texttt{nums\_subs}$ holds this.\\
Except for Most significant bit ($d_{k}$ which can be reasonably assumed to be 1), for each of the other bits of $d$, I assume $d_{i}$ ($i < k$) to be 1 and group messages depending on return value of $\texttt{mon\_pro}$ i.e $\texttt{true}$ (Group $\textbf{A}$) or $\texttt{false}$ (Group $\textbf{B}$). In code, variable $\texttt{d\_arr}$ holds this.\\
For each bit $d_{i}$, compute the average number of subtractions of messages in Group $\textbf{A}$ and Group $\textbf{B}$, if the difference is greater than 1, then predict $d_{i}$ to be 1 else predict 0.
\section{Code usage and results}
Attached is the file $\texttt{machiry\_monpro\_timing\_attack.py}$ that contains all the code. You can run the code as shown in the examples below:
